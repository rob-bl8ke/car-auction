## Command Line Stuff

Use these commands find out information about your .NET  SDK installations.

dotnet --info
dotnet new list

```
winget list --upgrade-available --include-unknown
winget install --id Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8

winget update --id Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8
```

Prepare the folder structure for the solution.
```
dir
mkdir car-auction
cd .\car-auction\
code . -n
```
If you do have multiple versions of .NET installed and you wish to use a specific version that isn't the latest version you can specify this in a `global.json` file. You can generate this file using `dotnet new globaljson` in your project folder.

It creates a file like:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "7.0.101"
  }
}

Build up the solution and its project structure.
```
dotnet new sln
dotnet new webapi -o src/AuctionService -controllers
dotnet sln add .\src\AuctionService
```
